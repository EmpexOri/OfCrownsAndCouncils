    je_seeking_glory_in_eastern_snow: "Seeking Glory in the Eastern Snow"
    je_seeking_glory_in_eastern_snow_reason: "The intelligentsia and elites of Polish-Lithuanian high society have set their sights on the eastern frontier, a narrow corridor of land linking the heart of the Commonwealth to the city of St. Bolesław. Control over these territories promises strategic advantage and access to vast natural resources that could enrich the Commonwealth’s landowners for generations."

    eastern_snow.1.t: "The Glory of the East"
    eastern_snow.1.d: "Ambitions of the Eastern Corridor"
    eastern_snow.1.f: "The leaders of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth have long viewed the eastern corridor as both a strategic and economic prize. St. Bolesław stands as a gateway to trade and influence in the north, and linking the Commonwealth’s heartland to this city would secure vital lines of communication. Local landowners and nobles argue that controlling these lands would unlock vast natural resources, from fertile soil to timber and minerals. Intellectuals and members of the intelligentsia support this expansion, claiming it is necessary to ensure the Commonwealth’s prosperity and cultural influence in the region. With both strategic and economic arguments in hand, the Commonwealth begins to justify its designs on these eastern territories to its people and allies alike."

    je_polish_regency: "The Regency of Empress Aasa"
    je_polish_regency_reason: "In late 1835, Emperor Bolesław Ostrogski died of typhoid fever, leaving the Polish throne to his seven year old daughter, Aasa Ostrogski. The King’s Royal Council, dominated by Artists and Aristocrats, elected to uphold her succession through a Regency, a decision that proved deeply contentious among the staunchly traditional Army and Church."

    polish_regency.1.d: "The Ascension of Empress Aasa"
    polish_regency.1.f: "Before the assembled court, the crown of Poland was placed upon the brow of Aasa Ostrogski, her small hands scarcely able to bear its weight as the oaths of rule were sworn in her name. Bells rang and banners were raised across the capital, even as the Army and the Church watched in uneasy silence, uncertain whether they were witnessing the dawn of stability or the beginning of discord."

    polish_regency.2.d: "The Empress Takes Her Crown"
    polish_regency.2.f: "At eighteen years of age, Aasa Ostrogski stood before the assembled estates and received the crown in her own right, bringing an end to the long Regency that had ruled in her name. As Empress of Poland and Queen of Lithuania, her oath bound two realms together once more, and the weight of the crown now rested fully upon her shoulders."

    je_gold_of_golden_horde: "The Gold of the Golden Horde"
    je_gold_of_golden_horde_reason: "The Commonwealth seeks to claim the Golden Horde’s eastern remnants to demonstrate its restored imperial might, secure the wealth of the Siberian steppes, and legitimize its monarchy in the eyes of nobles, clergy, and foreign observers. Conquest brings prestige, resource bonuses, and enhanced governmental legitimacy."

    eastern_snow.2.d: "The Golden East"
    eastern_snow.2.f: "Following the successes of the eastern campaigns, the Royal Council turns its attention to the steppes once ruled by the Golden Horde. Buoyed by recent victories and the prestige they brought, merchants, generals, and administrators see the wealth of Siberia’s forests and mineral-rich mountains as the next prize for the Commonwealth, and a chance to further strengthen the state and its legitimacy in the eyes of the nation. Yet not all voices are united, some argue that the time might be better spent consolidating the realm internally rather than venturing further into war."

    eastern_snow.2.b: "Perhaps we should instead focus internally, away from war?"

    je_polish_southern_expedition: "Marzec: Southern Expedition"
    je_polish_southern_expedition_reason: "Old wounds linger from past wars with the Mughal Empire, and the loss of a treaty port remains an insult yet unanswered. By carving away the empire’s vulnerable Caucasian territories, the Commonwealth seeks both retribution and the restoration of its honor."
    je_polish_western_expedition: "Marzec: Western Expedition"
    je_polish_western_expedition_reason: "The fractured German states remain the key to dominance in Central Europe, and the Commonwealth cannot allow rivals to consolidate where it is strongest. Through force or submission, Poland-Lithuania will assert itself as the unquestioned arbiter of the German heartlands."
    je_polish_northern_expedition: "Marzec: Northern Expedition"
    je_polish_northern_expedition_reason: "The Crown looks north toward Estonia, ancestral homeland of the Norwegian royal house, where conquest promises little in material gain but much in glory. Reclaiming these lands would cement the Commonwealth’s prestige as a power that shapes history, not merely borders."

    eastern_snow.3.t: "The Three Horizons"
    eastern_snow.3.d: "The Three Horizons"
    eastern_snow.3.f: "The Commonwealth prepares to assert its influence across multiple fronts. In the north, the homeland of the Norwegian kings in Estonia beckons, a venture undertaken as much for glory as for strategic advantage. To the west, the German states must be brought into line to secure Poland-Lithuania’s position as the dominant power in Central Europe, ensuring our authority among the continent’s great powers. In the south, old rivalries with the Mughal Empire call for decisive action to reclaim lost territories in the Caucasus and restore our access to vital ports. These campaigns will test the resolve of our council, the skill of our generals, and the loyalty of our allies, yet their success promises prestige, legitimacy, and the expansion of our economic and military power.."

From this strife, the House von Glaublitz emerged victorious, with Luidolf I claiming the crown, though not without cost, for the conflict saw the loss of the crown jewels of empire, most grievously the colonies of Magna Meridia and Arden Aurora in South America. Now, under the rule of Emperor Luidolf III, the Empire seeks to reclaim its prestige and standing among the Great Powers, not through empty ceremony, but through decisive action. The vast riches of the Amazon and the Andes lie within reach, and their exploitation has been decreed as the foremost goal of the Sardo-Burgandian state, a means by which the Empire shall restore its merit, wealth, and authority upon the world stage."

The great trading houses reclaim their routes, bureaucrats reassert regulation over colonial revenues, and investors speak openly of renewed confidence in overseas enterprise.

    norwegian_century.1.f: "Following the collapse of our empire in the late fifteenth century, the crowns of Norway passed through hardship and division. Under the rule of the Sten dynasty, and later the House of Paijkull, the realm was reunited and raised beyond its former stature. With the passing of Prince Vidkun X Göinge, authority now rests with his consort, Her Majesty Queen Aasa Paijkull, whose long life has witnessed Norway’s transformation into one of Europe’s foremost centers of scientific thought. In the twilight of her reign, the Queen and her council look not to conquest, but to learning, innovation, and the strengthening of both the homeland and the American colonies. In her honor, we commit ourselves to the advancement of knowledge and the founding of universities, marking the dawn of what shall be remembered as the Norwegian Century."
