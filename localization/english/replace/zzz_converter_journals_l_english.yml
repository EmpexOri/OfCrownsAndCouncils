    sick_man_mug.1.f:0 "We have fallen, but we can rise again. In an Auspicious Incident we deposed the Rajputs who had maintained their miserly grip on power for centuries, finally allowing reform to be possible. There is much more to do. First, of course, we need to replace the Rajputs with a truly modern military force. But in addition, we must restore the place of the Sublime Devan as the very height of civilization.

A landscape once dominated by peasant farmers is now littered with shining cities. And to think that only a few decades ago the empire was on the brink of collapse! Where once the European powers looked upon us with pity and greedily sought to partition our lands, now we see their diplomats gazing in awe at our accomplishments, forced to recognize us as equals.

    je_seeking_glory_in_eastern_snow_reason: "The intelligentsia and elites of Polish-Lithuanian high society have set their sights on the eastern frontier, a narrow corridor of land linking the heart of the Commonwealth to the city of St. Bolesław. Control over these territories promises strategic advantage and access to vast natural resources that could enrich the Commonwealth’s landowners for generations."

    eastern_snow.1.d: "Ambitions of the Eastern Corridor"
    eastern_snow.1.f: "The leaders of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth have long viewed the eastern corridor as both a strategic and economic prize. St. Bolesław stands as a gateway to trade and influence in the north, and linking the Commonwealth’s heartland to this city would secure vital lines of communication. Local landowners and nobles argue that controlling these lands would unlock vast natural resources, from fertile soil to timber and minerals. Intellectuals and members of the intelligentsia support this expansion, claiming it is necessary to ensure the Commonwealth’s prosperity and cultural influence in the region. With both strategic and economic arguments in hand, the Commonwealth begins to justify its designs on these eastern territories to its people and allies alike."

    je_polish_regency_reason: "In late 1835, Emperor Bolesław Ostrogski died of typhoid fever, leaving the Polish throne to his seven year old daughter, Aasa Ostrogski. The King’s Royal Council, dominated by Artists and Aristocrats, elected to uphold her succession through a Regency, a decision that proved deeply contentious among the staunchly traditional Army and Church."

    polish_regency.1.f: "Before the assembled court, the crown of Poland was placed upon the brow of Aasa Ostrogski, her small hands scarcely able to bear its weight as the oaths of rule were sworn in her name. Bells rang and banners were raised across the capital, even as the Army and the Church watched in uneasy silence, uncertain whether they were witnessing the dawn of stability or the beginning of discord."

    polish_regency.2.f: "At eighteen years of age, Aasa Ostrogski stood before the assembled estates and received the crown in her own right, bringing an end to the long Regency that had ruled in her name. As Empress of Poland and Queen of Lithuania, her oath bound two realms together once more, and the weight of the crown now rested fully upon her shoulders."
